# Portfolio - Flutter Website

This is the code that is used to generate the website @ https://justin.directory
Contributions are not welcome, as this is a portfolio and requires my own work, but you are free to use this code if you would wish to do so.

## Why Flutter?

I decided upon Flutter as it provided a means for me to create a UI seamlessly using Google's Material Design.
Along with this, Flutter acts as a pretty good all-arounder for creating applications for all the possible targets that you would want to develop for, making it valuable to show knowledge of.
